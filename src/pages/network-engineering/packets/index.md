## Packets
A packet is a formatted piece of data carried by a network. When a device sends data to another device, it breaks the data into chunks (the payload) and adds some header information. The header assists with things like routing and error checking.

 Packet switched networks are generally more efficient compared to circuit switched networks. Circuit switched network needs to reserve resources for the duration of communication. Packet switched networks can send packets on demand.

  In the OSI model, packets correspond to layer 3, the Network Layer.
